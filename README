swim - simple window manager
============================
swim is a quick and tiny window manager for X.

Requirements
------------
swim required the Xlib header files alongside a few optional extensions.

Installation
------------
swim comes with a Makefile and config.mk file for configurable building and
testing.  Edit the latter to match your local setup (swim is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default, you may need to modify your $PATH).

swim can be built and installed with the following command (run as root):

    make clean install


Usage
-----
swim can be run by adding it to the .xinitrc file or by supplying it as an
argument to startx.  Add the following line to the end of your .xinitrc file if
using the former option:

    exec swim


Configuration
-------------
swim can be configured by editing the generated config.h file and (re)compiling
the source code.  This keeps it fast, simple, and secure.
